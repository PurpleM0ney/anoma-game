## ✍️ How to play with intents  

You can play Anoma 2048 in two ways:  
1. **Classic controls** - use your arrow keys (↑ ↓ ← →) to move tiles.  
2. **Intent-based controls** - type an intent into the input box and press **Enter**.  

Supported intents:  
- `up`, `down`, `left`, `right` → move tiles in that direction  
- `new game` / `restart` / `reset` → start a new session instantly  
- Fun aliases:  
  - `moon` / `bull` / `to the moon` → move **up**  
  - `dump` / `bear` / `rekt` → move **down**  
  - `shrimp` / `🦐` → move **left**  

Every action you type gets parsed as an intent, routed by a solver, and executed in-game, just like how [Anoma](https://x.com/anoma) handles intents on-chain!
